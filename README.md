# mtots

Code for the `mtots` scripting language.
This repo is for building a "batteries included" version of the language.
The `mtots_core` repository contains a version of `mtots` with no external
dependencies.

In addition to `cargo test`, I like to run some tests with:

    cargo run -- samples/tests
